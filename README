Plugin for openSUSE build service that will list all open requests* on a project with a list of hashtags found in the request diff.

Patterns can be used to identify bugs, features, etc.

What it is this for?

Very often we are flooded by requests to a project and it is difficult to
to group them. This way, if you add some hashtags in your changes file, this
plugin will list them and make life easier for the reviewer.

Example

We have packages foo, bar, and hola.
foo bar are fixing bug#123 and hola is for feature#3.

Then, in the foo and bar changelog, we will add "bug#123" and in the hola
changelog, "feature#3".

Then, we will submit the three packages to openSUSE:super_product.

The "release manager" of super_product will then run

osc requests_tags openSUSE:super_product

and the output will something like

request_id: 1 bug#123
request_id: 2 bug#123
request_id: 3 feature#3

Then, he may decide to accept request 1 and 2 into his test/staging project and
after that, accepte feature 3. 

The RPM is being built under:

You can use that RPM to install it. I.e. for Tumbleweed:
